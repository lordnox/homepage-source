    <h1>This is a personal Webservice!</h1>
    <p>This webservice is written by <a href="mailto:Tobias Kopelke <kopelke@gmail.com>">Tobias Kopelke</a> and written for personal use, testing out new things and getting access to my own data on the Google plattform.</p>
    <p>The code is available on <a href="https://github.com/raynode/glare">Github</a> if you are interessted.</p>
    <p>Any user that is created by anyone is here at her or his own risk, be sure to write me an email if there is something I need to delete. Actually, you should know me in real live before getting on the server in the first place.</p>
    <p>Most data on the server is wiped regularly, and I really do not care about it, as long as it is my own.</p>
